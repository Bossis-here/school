      <h1>Purpose of Life</h1>
      <p>Beyond academics, beyond achievement — the real journey begins within.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="inner-awareness">
      <h2>Awakening the Inner Self</h2>
      <p>We often live life chasing external goals, forgetting that peace and fulfillment come from within. At Twinkle Star School, students are invited to reflect deeply on who they are, what they feel, and why they exist.</p>
      <p>Purpose is not something given — it is something discovered through silence, observation, and self-inquiry.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mindfulness-path">
      <h2>The Journey Inward</h2>
      <p>Each student is encouraged to explore mindfulness practices, meditation, and thoughtful silence. In doing so, they begin to unlock their intuition and inner clarity — qualities that define true intelligence.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quiet moments in nature and reflection</li>
        <li>Creative expression through art, poetry, and music</li>
        <li>Personal journaling to discover emotions and goals</li>
        <li>Conscious breathing and body awareness practices</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="beyond-goals">
      <h2>Living Without Comparison</h2>
      <p>We teach our children not to become someone else, but to fully become themselves. Purpose is not found in competition — it blossoms in uniqueness. Every student is a universe of potential, not a number in a race.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="light-inside">
      <h2>Becoming a Light</h2>
      <p>When students live with awareness, they radiate peace, joy, and creativity. They do not follow — they shine. They inspire not by effort, but by presence. That is the mark of one who has found purpose.</p>
