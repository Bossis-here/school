      <h1>Our Role in Society</h1>
      <p>Inspired by Viktor E. Frankl’s timeless work, <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>, we strive to instill deep purpose and responsibility in our students from an early age.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="insight-section">
      <h2>Understanding Meaning</h2>
      <p>Viktor Frankl, a Holocaust survivor, neurologist, and psychiatrist, emphasized that life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose. At Twinkle Star School, we encourage students to explore their unique value in the world.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how'." — Viktor E. Frankl
      </blockquote>

      <p>Through critical thinking, compassion, and real-world learning, we help students uncover their "why" — their reason to contribute to family, community, and country.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="responsibility-section">
      <h2>Building a Responsible Generation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Encouraging civic values and public service participation</li>
        <li>Fostering empathy through community outreach</li>
        <li>Environment-focused awareness and sustainability clubs</li>
        <li>Understanding rights and duties through real-world simulations</li>
        <li>Teaching accountability with school leadership programs</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="action-section">
      <h2>Acting with Purpose</h2>
      <p>Man’s Search for Meaning reminds us that action is the key to meaning. We emphasize:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Finding purpose through challenges</li>
        <li>Turning suffering into achievement and growth</li>
        <li>Making ethical choices in small and big decisions</li>
        <li>Living life with intention and service to others</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="reflection-section">
      <h2>What Our Students Say</h2>
      <p>"We planted trees near the highway last month. It felt good to protect the environment for future generations." — Aarav, Grade 6</p>
      <p>"Helping the elderly in our neighborhood taught me more about respect and kindness than any textbook could." — Riya, Grade 8</p>
    </section>

    <section class="frankl-legacy">
      <h2>Frankl’s Legacy in Our Curriculum</h2>
      <p>Our educators include life-skills and reflection modules based on Viktor Frankl’s principles. Children engage with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Story-based moral dilemmas to encourage independent thought</li>
        <li>Reflection journals every week on personal growth</li>
        <li>Meaningful projects related to history, society, and humanity</li>
        <li>Regular student-led debates on ethical topics</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="join-us-section">
      <h2>Be a Force for Good</h2>
      <p>We are not just teaching subjects, we are nurturing future citizens. Every student is empowered to make a difference in the world around them — just as Frankl believed.</p>
      <p>Come, be a part of Twinkle Star School. Let’s build a more thoughtful, meaningful society together.</p>
